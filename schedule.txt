1. Data preprocess
	include:
	extract 5-character poems from .json file
	get familiar with CIFAR100 and load it
	create a dictionary between key word and class name
	word2vec training or other methods to do embedding
2. Model
	for image classifier:
		should use a pretrained model from https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100
	for seq2seq model:
		need attention mechanism
		need to learn from scratch
3. Problems need to be discussed
	textrank? or some efficient way do poems embedding
	(TF-IDF might worth a try https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/41091116)
	just a key word to do seq2seq? need a precise interface between models(more key words are generated randomly based on the 1st one to form a sequnce of which length is 4(写中文吧，英文太费劲))
	can we do some improvement. pictures to poem or poems?
